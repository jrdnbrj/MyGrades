            <br><hr><br><h2>Key differences in data protection rules</h2>
            <p>MyGrades fully and proactively supports the transition to simplified, more uniform application of the law as it applies to data protection in other countries. Following are some notable changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There used to be ambiguity about what companies could do with personal data vs. anonymous identifiers. Germany doesn’t typically recognize anonymous data. New regulations apply to ALL data collected, with the intent being to make it harder to profile people.</li>
                <li>The GDPR makes it more clear that the U.S. must play by the EU’s rules and obtain valid, opt-in consent, using clear language, to use personal information.</li>
                <li>The GDPR requires much more accountability when processing information. Privacy must be embedded into everything (services, software, systems, and processes) by design and by default. The expectation is that the ability to erase data will be mandatory as well.</li>
                <li>Under the GDPR, public authorities and companies that depend on processing personal information will be required to hire a data protection officer (DPO), who will be responsible for making sure that legal data processes are upheld.</li>
                <li>Individuals’ rights are being strengthened. For example, cookie policies now should be much more clearly communicated and obvious.</li>
                <li>To export data, model clauses will be favored, which MyGrades uses. There is no real mention of Safe Harbor, but nothing prohibits it. Different model clauses can be used to meet specific privacy requirements.</li>
            </ul>
